It's been a year since we first went public with the concept of connecting nonprofits to qualified digital security trainers.

I'm happy to write that after many months of design and development, our launch is imminent! We’re putting the final touches on the DSX website, our secure intake forms, and our backend ticketing and issue tracking system. We plan to make it all live in the next few weeks. Here’s a glimpse of the homepage:

Since then, we’ve been busy designing and building our public website and secure intake forms, partnering with [CiviCDR](https://civicdr.org/) to integrate its custom-built ticketing system, and building a community of organizational partners and digital security providers. Our friends at [Echo & Co.](https://echo.co/) and [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) have been key to making this site beautiful, accessible, and secure.

Our Partnerships Director, Debbie Mac, has built a program that includes:

- A process for onboarding participating organizations
- Connecting orgs to a community of their peers
- Assessing organizational threat models and suggesting strategies to match those needs
- Connecting organizations to digital security providers who can provide in-person or remote trainings, audit security practices, or advise on technical projects

The last year has also helped us understand what kind of organizations could use our help, and what kind of help they need. So far, participating organizations have been clustered around a few core issues, including women’s rights/gender equity, immigration, and journalism. Of course, we’re committed to serving any group that is working to advance social, racial, political, and economic justice in our communities and our world.

To further our goal of providing that help, we’ve developed a strong network of more than a dozen trusted digital security providers who can address incoming requests.

There will be much more to share soon! In the meantime, please send a note to [josh@digitalsecurityexchange.org](mailto:josh@digitalsecurityexchange.org) if your organization is interested getting assistance, if you would like to request to join our provider network, or if you have other ideas for getting involved.

We’re grateful to Omidyar Network, Mozilla Foundation, and Small Media Foundation for their financial contributions to DSX in 2017. We’re now seeking financial support help to carry this work through 2018.  Please [email me](mailto:josh@digitalsecurityexchange.org) if you are interesting in contributing.
