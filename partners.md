# Digital Security Exchange (DSX) Organizational Partner Concept

The DSX pairs social sector organizations with credible and trustworthy digital security experts and trainers who can help them keep their data and networks safe from exposure, exploitation, and attack.

We help increase the safety and security of community-based organizations, legal and journalistic organizations, local and national organizers, public and high-profile figures, and those who are working to advance social, racial, political, and economic justice in our communities and our world. We do this by forming informal and formal partnerships with these organizations, helping address immediate needs by connecting organizations to rapid response incident handlers, and working together to assess and address organizations' needs, address short-term security challenges, and develop long-term capacity building strategies.

DSX organizational partners will have access to our backend system that allows partners to create profiles articulating their needs, connect directly to digital security providers within the DSX network, and receive notifications and updates about current threats and digital security trends.

We are establishing two models of support for nonprofit organizations: Quick handoffs to participating providers and long-term engagements. For the former, organizations may be seeking one-time assistance addressing a technical problem, addressing an attack, or securing a web presence. For the latter, organizations can partner with the DSX to develop a rolling strategy for assessing and addressing their needs and connecting to one or more providers who can help.

Below are a number of workflow scenarios for partner organizations, most of which will be operational upon our website launch:

1. Organization contacts DSX through secure or insecure means:

- Webform on web site (encrypted, temporarily stored on our server before passed to our database)
- Email (plain text)
- Email (encrypted)
- Signal (encrypted)
- Phone call (unencrypted)

2. DSX determines the type of request/necessary response:

- Rapid response
- Action needed but not urgent
- Long-term assistance

3. DSX determines next steps:

- Follow up phone call or email
- Directly connect to partner provider
- No response needed

4. After initial intake conversation:

- If necessary, DSX establishes secure communication channels and plan of action
- Establish whether organization needs one-off or mid- to long-term support
- If long-term, onboard as a â€œpartner organization," including access to DSX backend database

5. For new partner organizations:

- On-demand access DSX backend including opportunity to build organizational profile
- Regular checkins with DSX staff about current needs and long-term strategies
- As needed, DSX facilitates relationships with appropriate providers
